## NON-NEGOTIABLE PRODUCT INVARIANT: DEDICATED CLI PARITY

**WORKING WITH ONE SPECIFIC PARTICIPANT IN ACCORDAGENTS CHAT MUST FEEL LIKE WORKING WITH THAT AGENT THROUGH ITS REGULAR, DEDICATED CLI.**

Before every product, architecture, implementation, UI, and commit decision, explicitly check that this invariant still holds. AccordAgents must mirror the current CLI behavior at the time a feature is implemented, including output rendering and streaming, permissions and approvals, sandboxing, model selection, sessions and resume behavior, compaction, goals, skills and rules, MCPs and tools, cancellation, errors, warnings, and user controls. The user should not need to learn different single-agent behavior merely because the agent is running inside AccordAgents.

Treat the dedicated CLI as the source of truth. Do not invent app-specific semantics for a single participant when the CLI already defines them. If multi-participant coordination inherently requires a difference, keep the divergence as narrow as possible, make it visible to the user, document why it exists, and add verification for both the parity path and the divergence. CLI behavior can evolve; verify the current behavior when implementing or revisiting a feature rather than relying on an old assumption. Any unexplained mismatch is a product correctness bug.

## Commands

Prefer the Makefile aliases; they wrap the npm scripts in `package.json`.

- `make dev` — Vite dev server + Electron with live reload. Internally runs `npm run build:main` first because Electron loads the compiled main/preload from `dist/main` even in dev.
- `make build` — Compile main process (`tsc -p tsconfig.main.json`) then `vite build` the renderer.
- `make start` — Build, then run Electron from `dist`.
- `make typecheck` — Strict TS checks for both main and renderer projects (`tsc --noEmit` against each tsconfig).
- `make clean` — Remove `dist`.
- `npm run test:accord` — Build the main process, then run focused Accord launcher preference and target reconciliation tests.
- `npm run test:permissions` — Build the main process, then run targeted Node service tests for chat permissions/cancellation, repo file mentions, chat rename, role archive behavior, participant request threads, git repo-file listing, CLI permission handling, and warnings.
- `npm run test:app-skills` — Build the main process, then run app-skill service tests.

There is no single full-project lint suite. Before submitting changes, run `make typecheck` and (for renderer changes) `make build`. Renderer guardrails are available through `make lint-colors`, `make lint-lines`, and `make lint-unused`. For chat permissions, cancellation, repo-file mentions, rename, git repo-file listing, CLI permission behavior, role archive behavior, participant request threads, or warnings, run `npm run test:permissions`. For app-skill service changes, run `npm run test:app-skills`. Manual verification notes are expected in PRs whenever IPC, provider integrations, git diff handling, conversation storage, or chat concurrency are touched.

Debug logs (JSONL of progress events and raw provider/CLI output) are written to Electron's `userData/debug-logs/<date>.jsonl`. The `DebugLogService` enables them automatically when running unpackaged; force on/off with `ACCORD_AGENTS_DEBUG_LOGS=1` / `=0`.

## Inspecting the running desktop app

Whenever the user asks you to **see**, **screenshot**, **scroll**, **click**, **type into**, or **read DOM/CSS state in** the running app — for reproducing UI bugs, verifying a renderer fix, or any UI-driven check — follow `docs/inspecting-the-desktop-app.md`. It uses the Chrome DevTools Protocol against Electron's renderer (port 9222). Do NOT use macOS `screencapture`, AppleScript, `CGWindowList`, or any window-focus tricks, and do NOT try to hit `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` directly — that's Vite's bundle without the Electron preload and the React app crashes when loaded that way.

In AccordAgents Chat, use the repo-local `/electron-desktop-qa` skill for this workflow. It requires retrying localhost/CDP launch failures with escalation before reporting desktop UI QA as blocked.

## Architecture

This is an Electron desktop app for coordinating AI agents in one shared project workspace. The current product surface is AccordAgents Chat: project chats with local CLI participants backed by Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini (Antigravity CLI, `agy`), reusable roles, behavior rules, decisions, permissions, and history kept together so context can carry across sessions and providers. There are three TS projects compiled separately:

- `src/main` (CommonJS, Node target) — Electron main process. Compiled to `dist/main`. The Electron entrypoint resolves to `dist/main/main/main.js` (see `package.json#main`).
- `src/preload` — Compiled together with main. Exposes the IPC bridge to the renderer via `contextBridge`.
- `src/renderer` (ESNext, DOM target) — React app bundled by Vite into `dist/renderer`.
- `src/shared` — Imported by all three; this is where the wire format lives.

### The `src/shared/types.ts` contract

`src/shared/types.ts` defines `AppBridge`, the complete IPC surface. Every IPC handler in `src/main/main.ts`, every method in `src/preload/index.ts`, and every renderer call site must stay in sync with this file. When adding an IPC route, update all three layers plus the type. Renderer code reaches the main process exclusively via `window.consensus` (typed by `src/preload/global.d.ts`); there is no direct Node access from the renderer (`contextIsolation: true`, `sandbox: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`).

### Service layout (main process)

`src/main/main.ts` instantiates services once at startup and wires them to IPC handlers. Chat runs, participant compaction, mention continuations, and legacy review/plan flows accept a per-run `AbortController` keyed by `runId` in the `activeReviews` map; `conversations:cancel-review` aborts that controller. Progress is streamed back to the renderer via the legacy-named `conversations:review-progress` channel and snapshot updates via `conversations:updated`.

Services in `src/main/services`:

- `chat.ts` — The current product orchestration service for the `chat` conversation kind. Maintains per-participant CLI sessions (`ChatParticipantSession`) with persistent `sessionId`s so Codex/Claude resume context across turns. Mention approvals (`ChatPendingMention`) gate when an `@handle` triggers another agent. Chat sends ingest the user message synchronously, then fan out mentioned participants in the background. Each target run has its own `runId`/`AbortController`; `metadata.activeRunIds` is the active-run source of truth, with `metadata.running`/`metadata.runId` kept for compatibility. Concurrent chat writes must go through `withChatMutation`, which waits for queued saves and refreshes/merges storage before mutating. Do not emit `queueSnapshot` or call `saveConversation` directly from long-running chat-turn code. Same-participant turns serialize via `participantTurnQueues`, while different participants can run concurrently. `cancelRun(runId)` may abort multiple controllers because resume flows can share a run id, so active run bookkeeping is ref-counted.
- `consensus.ts` — Legacy review/consensus and implementation-plan orchestration. It still backs stored non-chat conversations and remaining IPC paths, but it is not the current user-facing product surface. Be careful around `ConversationKind` branching because `general`, `code-review`, and `implementation-plan` data may still exist in storage or compatibility code.
- `providers.ts` — HTTP providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). Reads API keys from `SettingsService` at call time. Normalizes responses to a `ParticipantRunResult`.
- `cliAgents.ts` — Runs `codex`, `claude`, and `agy` (Antigravity/Gemini) CLIs. Detects them via `which`, then spawns `codex exec` / `claude` with carefully constructed argv: `--sandbox read-only`, `--cd <repo>`, `--skip-git-repo-check` for non-repo or `chat` runs, `--ephemeral --ignore-rules` when no repo is selected. Resumes Codex sessions via `codex exec resume <sessionId>`. Output goes through a temp `--output-last-message` file; raw stdout is mostly progress JSON. Gemini runs use `agy --print --output-format json` (built by `geminiExec.ts`), resume via `--conversation <id>`, tail the per-run `--log-file` plus the Antigravity brain transcript for early session ids and live activity, and reach app MCP tools through the bundled `geminiMcpProxy.js` registered in `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (per-run URL/token via env).
- `settings.ts` — Reads/writes JSON settings under Electron `userData`. API keys are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage`; `hasApiKey` is the only key-related field exposed to the renderer. Owns `chatRoleConfigs` (instruction templates), `chatBehaviorRules` (reusable per-participant rule snippets), and `chatParticipantConfigs` (handle/role/CLI bindings) used by `ChatService`. See `docs/chat-roles-and-participants.md` before changing chat role presets, behavior rules, participant configs, or runtime session behavior.
- `storage.ts` — Persists conversations to a SQLite DB at `userData/accordagents.sqlite3`. **Storage shells out to the `sqlite3` CLI** (`runCommand("sqlite3", ...)`); there is no native binding. The schema stores conversation summaries/payloads in `conversations` and paginated message rows in `conversation_messages`. On startup `clearInterruptedRuns` clears `metadata.running`, `metadata.runId`, and `metadata.activeRunIds` state and appends an interrupted-run warning when needed, so a crash mid-run leaves a recoverable record.
- `git.ts` — Wraps `git` for repo inspection and the various `GitDiffMode` values. `pasted` mode bypasses git entirely.
- `command.ts` — `runCommand` helper used by every service that spawns a subprocess. Honors `AbortSignal`, enforces `timeoutMs` with SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation. CLI runs use `CLI_AGENT_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS = 15 * 60_000`; sqlite calls use 10s.

### Renderer

`src/renderer/App.tsx` is now a composition root for shell, settings, chat, and legacy review views. Most UI behavior lives in `src/renderer/app/*` hooks and `src/renderer/components/**`. State is local React state plus subscriptions to `onReviewProgress` / `onConversationUpdated`. Chat sends should not set the global `busy` flag; active chat state is per-conversation/per-run. The chat UI derives per-message Stop controls from `message.metadata.runId`, and Stop all from `metadata.activeRunIds` plus pending message run ids. Styles are split under `src/renderer/styles`; assets are in `src/renderer/assets`.

### Warning sanitization

`src/shared/warnings.ts` is shared because both the main process (when generating warnings during a run) and storage (when reading old conversations) must produce identical output. CLI agents occasionally dump raw event JSON into stderr; `sanitizeWarningText` collapses those into a one-line "see debug logs" notice and drops obsolete patterns. Any time you push a new warning into `conversation.metadata.warnings`, it should already be a clean human sentence — sanitization is the safety net, not the formatter.

### Conversation persistence model

Conversations are append-mostly. Chat conversations store timeline messages plus `metadata.participants`, `metadata.participantSessions`, run state, warnings, app-tool approvals, and participant-request state; `findings` is usually empty for chat. Legacy review/plan conversations still use `findings`, embedded `rounds`, and plan-decision metadata. `chat.ts` snapshots chat through queued `withChatMutation` paths so concurrent participant runs do not overwrite each other. When adding a new long-running flow, follow the existing pattern: emit progress, mutate through the owning service, queue a save, and push a snapshot via `onConversationSnapshot`.

## Code conventions

- 2-space indent, double quotes, semicolons, named imports. `PascalCase` for components/classes, `camelCase` for everything else.
- Strict TS everywhere; keep types explicit at IPC, service, and shared boundaries. Add new shapes to `src/shared/types.ts` rather than redefining them on either side of the bridge.
- Do not commit provider API keys, local repo paths, generated logs, `node_modules`, or `dist`. Treat saved conversations and `debug-logs/` as sensitive — they contain prompts, diffs, and raw model responses.

## Skill routing

- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan

- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
